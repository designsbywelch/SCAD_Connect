## 🖤 What Is This?

**SCAD_Connect** is a student-built digital bridge forged in resilience.

It’s a modern platform built to connect **SCAD freshmen** with **upperclassmen mentors** — but it’s more than that... it’s a bold statement.

> SCAD might’ve fumbled, but I flipped the whole playbook.

This project lives in the space between rejection and reinvention — proof that creativity can’t be boxed, especially when built from purpose, grit, and unmatched drip.
